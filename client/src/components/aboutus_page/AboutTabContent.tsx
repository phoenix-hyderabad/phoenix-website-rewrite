        There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as
        yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best
        of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never
        come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal?
        And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago,
        fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?
        <br />
        We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade
        and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are
        hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of
        our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are
        willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we
        intend to win, and the others, too.
